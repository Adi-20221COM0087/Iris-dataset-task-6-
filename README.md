# Iris-dataset-task-6-
In this task, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was implemented to perform classification using the Iris dataset. The dataset was first preprocessed by dropping the unnecessary 'Id' column and normalizing the feature values to ensure fair distance calculations. The model was trained using KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn, and its performance was evaluated across different values of K (from 1 to 20) to identify the optimal number of neighbors. The best K value was selected based on the highest classification accuracy. Model performance was assessed using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, all of which showed perfect classification. Finally, the decision boundaries of the trained KNN model were visualized using two key features—Petal Length and Petal Width—allowing a clear understanding of how the model separates different Iris species in 2D space.
